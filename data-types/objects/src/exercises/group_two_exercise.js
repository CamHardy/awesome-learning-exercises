// Group Exercise 2 - Emptying an Object by using its reference

// This is a multi step exercise which should help us build a good mental model
// of how object references work in JavaScript.

// In this exercise, implement the body for the function below, empty(),
// which empties an object which is passed into it.
// It must empty ALL OBJECTS (remember: what type is an array?)
function empty(obj) {
  // YOUR SOLUTION HERE
  return obj;
}

export { empty };
